# Logistic-Lasso-Prediction-Task
In this project, I use Newton-Raphson method to estimate a logistic model, implement a coordinate-wise optimization algorithm to obtain a path of solution for the logisitc-LASSO model, and perform cross-validation to select the best tuning paramenter.

This is a class project for P8160 -- Statistical Computing at Columbia MSPH
